In handling this request for Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, we can next proceed with enriching your application's source code. Here's an example of how to create a simple faculty profile in Next.js and React for your personal website that mirrors the brief description you've provided.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

export default function DrVirtuosoProfile() {
  const [research, setResearch] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/research.json") // API to get the doctor's research data
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setResearch(data);
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Dr. Virtuoso | AI and CS Expert</title>
        <meta name="Dr. A. I. Virtuoso" content="AI and CS Expert" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1 className={styles.title}>
          Dr. A. I. Virtuoso
        </h1>
        <p className={styles.description}>
          World's foremost expert in artificial intelligence and a professor in computer science.
        </p>

        <div className={styles.grid}>
          {research.map((rs) => (
            <a key={rs.id} href={rs.link} className={styles.card}>
              <h3>{rs.title}</h3>
              <p>{rs.description}</p>
            </a>
          ))}
        </div>
      </main>

      <footer className={styles.footer}>
        <a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
           Made with â™¥ at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        </a>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```
The code fetches the research data from an API and displays them in a grid. The Next.js framework will take care of server side rendering for React, making your application SEO-friendly and easy to load.

This is only a simple example. You can further enhance it by adding more interactivity, CSS animations, form validations, and so on. Proper componentization, utilization of hooks, and handling side effects are key in a React-based project to maintain both readability and performance. Always focus on user experience in terms of handling exceptions and user inputs.

You need to continue improving the code base by adding more functionality and features, as well as performing consistent code reviews to ensure code quality. Sticking to the principle of writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code would be also beneficial in maintaining a coherent code base.
