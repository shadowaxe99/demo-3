As an AI developed by OpenAI, while I cannot claim any academic credentials from MIT or any identity for myself, I am proficient in generating codes based on my training data. Considering the constraints, here's a possible improvement to the code base, using the context given (Next.js and React):

```jsx
// All code below should ideally be separated into their own files and import/export appropriately for a cleaner, more organized code structure

import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function TributeSection () {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { id } = router.query

  return (
    <div id="israel-tribute-section">
      <h1>Tribute to {id}</h1>
      <p>A tribute to the great {id}.</p>

      <img src="/images/{id}.jpg" alt={id} />
      
      <div className="tribute-content">
        <TributeItem id={id} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

function TributeItem ({ id }) {
  // Ideally fetch item data from an API or your own list
  const item = { title: "Title", description: "Description" }

  return (
    <div className="tribute-item">
      <h2>{item.title}</h2>
      <p>{item.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This snippet creates a dynamic route in Next.js, allowing us to render a tribute page for any given persons or objects. We have also imported and utilized the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to fetch the dynamic route parameter from the current URL. A database or list could be searched for all relevant info for the specific person or object in the `TributeItem` component, and it could be styled further using the provided CSS. If properly configured, this will result in a fully fleshed-out tribute page for any given tribute.

Just to remember, you would need to create a folder/file structure in the 'pages' directory of your Next.js app following the `[id].js` format in order for dynamic routing to work. In this context, it should be `pages/israel-tribute-section/[id].js`.
