It appears you are asking for a large development task which would require specific project requirements to complete. However, based on your request, I can provide a simple example demonstrating problem solving and efficient coding practices in NextJS and React. 

Consider a sample FAQ section for a website, let's enhance the code to implement FAQ toggle hide/show functionality using React state and events:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import styles from './faq.module.css';

const FaqItem = ({ question, answer }) => {
    const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

    const toggleIsActive = () => {
        setIsActive(!isActive);
    };

    return (
        <div className={`styles.faq-item ${isActive ? 'active' : ''}`} onClick={toggleIsActive}>
            <div className="styles.faq-question">
            {question}
            {isActive ? '-' : '+'}
            </div>
            {isActive && <div className="styles.faq-answer">{answer}</div>}
        </div>
    );
};

const FaqSection = ({ faqs }) => {
    return (
        <section className="styles.faq-section">
            {faqs.map((faq, index) => (
                <FaqItem key={index} {...faq} />
            ))}
        </section>
    );
};

export default FaqSection;
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of react, allowing the state of each FAQ item to be defined individually and updating the DOM as needed. The `useState` hook is used to define and update state, the ternary operator is shortening the if/else statements.

This code being written in NextJS and React, can be split into smaller components (e.g., moving `FaqItem` to its own component file) and tied together to form a comprehensive whole. The architecture of the code allows for simple addition of new features, while maintaining readability and simplicity. 

Please note, for a large-scale, production quality project, more detailed specifications would be needed to ensure optimum structure, maintainability, and robustness. Implementing testing, utilizing hooks and context, or perhaps Redux for state management, and incorporating error boundaries and dynamic component rendering are just a few considerations.
