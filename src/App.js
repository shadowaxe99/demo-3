First, you need to do a code review to find the places and sections that need polishing, tightening, or extending. The review involves every component and its individual implementation. In the already written code, various components are imported and then used inside the App() function. Let's step into the shoes of Dr. A. I. Virtoous and improve this code.

Inside Global.css, the universal styles that apply across all components should be applied. However, if there are styles exclusive to a component, the styles should be compartmentalized to that individual component only. Hence, create individual CSS modules for each component as a first step. 

```javascript
// convert:
import './styles/global.css';
// to:
import styles from './styles/App.module.css';
```

Second, each component can be given a unique function to handle an event or process that is exclusive to that component. Imagine there's an event inside the FaqSection that needs to be handled.

```javascript
// Instead of simply rendering the component like this:
<FaqSection />
// We develop a function to handle the event and send the resultant data to the component as a prop:
function handleFAQ() {
  // handle the event
  // return the resultant data
}

<FaqSection clickEvent={handleFAQ} />
```

Another important thing to consider is checking the performance and speed of the application. React provides a Profiler API that can be used to measure the rendering of components. Wrap the elements in `<React.Profiler>` and asses it.

```jsx
<React.Profiler id="appProfiler" onRender={callback}>
  <UI />
  <FaqSection clickEvent={handleFAQ} />
  <CarouselDisplay />
  <DoorUnveiling />
  <AiDebateSection />
  <AiFortuneTeller />
  <IsraelTributeSection />
</React.Profiler>
```

The last point is considering error boundaries. To prevent the entire app from crashing when an error is encountered in a child component, it's good practice to wrap all your components in error boundaries. Create a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that handles error and wraps its children within.

Always remember: comments, clean code practices, and small commit chunks are your best friends, so colleagues can understand what you changed.

So these were some of the changes. There are still many aspects to consider, like optimizing unnecessary renders, memoizing components if necessary, checking for memory leaks, checking if re-render happens only when props really change, etc. To implement full changes, a deeper dive into actual component codes is necessary.
