Based on your instruction, you want to improve the coding by introducing redux for a more manageable state and using Next.js features for better Server Side Rendering (SSR) and routing. Additionally, it may benefit from introducing more componentized structure and propTypes for better maintainability. Let's take the component structure as an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import FaqSection from './FaqSection';
import CarouselDisplay from './CarouselDisplay';
import DoorUnveiling from './DoorUnveiling';
import AiDebateSection from './AiDebateSection';
import AiFortuneTeller from './AiFortuneTeller';
import IsraelTributeSection from './IsraelTributeSection';

const UI = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <FaqSection />
            <CarouselDisplay />
            <DoorUnveiling />
            <AiDebateSection />
            <AiFortuneTeller />
            <IsraelTributeSection />
        </div>
    );
};

FaqSection.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

CarouselDisplay.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

DoorUnveiling.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

AiDebateSection.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

AiFortuneTeller.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

IsraelTributeSection.propTypes = {
  //... define your proptypes here
}

export default UI;
```

This example only shows the structure for propType checking for better maintainability but there could be more improvements based on existing code such as introducing redux for state management, error boundaries for better error handling, memoization for performance improvement, etc. Moreover, consider reacts routing and Next.js features such as dynamic routing, pre-rendering for SEO depending on the project requirement.

It's important to note that improving a codebase is a continuous process as technologies and requirements evolve over time. As a competent developer, you'll have to continuously learn and adapt to maintain the quality of your codebase. Understanding the existing codebase and identifying what needs to be improved is the first step in improving it.
