Based on the context, it seems like the task here is to improve and enhance the React component `IsraelTributeSection`. As a muter coder with great expertise in AI and computer science, the focus would be on optimizing the performance, introducing better error handling, improving code readability and reusability, and ensuring the component functions as expected.

Given my expertise in Next.js, we can optimize the component to statically generate pages based on the `tributeData`. Here is a more comprehensive approach:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const tributeData = [
  {
    title: 'Title 1',
    content: 'Content 1',
  },
  {
    title: 'Title 2',
    content: 'Content 2',
  },
];

const IsraelTributeSection = () => {
  const handleTributeContent = (content) => {
    // Implement functionality to handle tribute content
    // To Do: Add more intricate and elaborate handling logic here
  };

  return (
    <div id="israel-tribute-section">
      {tributeData.map((item, index) => (
        <TributeContent 
          key={index}
          data={item}
          handleContent={handleTributeContent}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

const TributeContent = ({data, handleContent}) => {
  const { title, content } = data;

  return (
    <div onClick={() => handleContent(content)}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Replace tributeData with actual data fetching from an API or Database
  const tributeData = fetchData(); 

  return {
    props: {
      tributeData,
    },
    revalidate: 1, // In seconds
  };
}

export default IsraelTributeSection;
```

In this revised component:

- `TributeContent` is introduced to modularize the repetitive part of `IsraelTributeSection`. It improves code readability and reusability.
- Next.js's `getStaticProps` is used to fetch the data at build time and create static pages per tribute. This improves performance by serving pre-generated pages instead of server-side rendering on every request.
- The use of `revalidate` ensures the data is updated at the specified intervals, providing a balance between performance (stale data is served to visitors) and freshness of data.
  
Next steps would be to further refine the `handleTributeContent` method to interact and utilize the application state in a better way. Additionally, introduce a robust error handling mechanism for fetching data in `getStaticProps`. Make sure each piece of the codebase serves its purpose effectively and efficiently, that's how greatness is achieved.
