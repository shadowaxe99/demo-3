In order to make your code base in Next.js and React more effective, you could manage the state with Redux for complex state management needs, use Next.js for server-side rendering and optimization of your React application, and stick to the principle of single responsibility and composition for your components and functions. 

An example of using Redux and Next.js together in your React applications would look something like this:

```javascript
// Create a new file 'store.js'
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// The initial state of the app
const initialState = {
   faqData: [
    {
      question: 'Question 1',
      answer: 'Answer 1',
      open: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Question 2',
      answer: 'Answer 2',
      open: false
    },
    // Add more FAQ data here
  ]
}

// Redux reducer
function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_FAQ':
      return {
        ...state,
        faqData: state.faqData.map((faq, i) => {
            if (i === action.index) {
              faq.open = !faq.open;
            } else {
              faq.open = false;
            }
            return faq;
          })
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

export function initializeStore() {
  return createStore(reducer, initialState)
}

```

Then in your component file, you would wrap it with a provider and use actions to dispatch state changes:

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { initializeStore } from '../store';
import FaqSection from '../components/FaqSection';

const store = store_initialize();
// ...
return (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <FaqSection />
  </Provider>
);

export default App;
```

And in the `FaqSection` component:

```javascript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

// ...
const faqData = useSelector(state => state.faqData);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

const handleFaqToggle = index => {
  dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_FAQ', index });
};

return (
  // Same as before
);
```

This would allow you to manage the FAQ toggle events in a scalable way. Be cognizant of the size and complexity of your app to decide whether you need an external state management, as simple application typically don't need one. To maintain the cleanness and readability of the code, use comments and descriptive variable names. Furthermore, remember to think through all possible edge cases, considering unexpected input or user behavior to make your code robust.

Lastly, make sure to apply good development practices including version control with a system such as Git, regularly testing your code with frameworks such as Jest, and doing code reviews.
