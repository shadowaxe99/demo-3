/**
 * This file contains the documentation for the codebase of the Futuristic Interactive Features and Israel Tribute Section.
 * The codebase is built using React, Next.js, CSS3, and JavaScript.
 * 
 * The main components of the codebase are:
 * 1. App.js: This is the main entry point of the application.
 * 2. components: This directory contains all the React components used in the application.
 * 3. utils: This directory contains utility functions for performance optimization and data sanitization.
 * 4. tests: This directory contains all the tests for the application.
 * 5. docs: This directory contains the documentation for the codebase and a user guide.
 * 6. styles: This directory contains all the CSS files for styling the components.
 * 7. public: This directory contains the index.html file and other public assets.
 * 
 * Shared dependencies:
 * The shared dependencies across the components are the exported variables from each file, data schemas, DOM element IDs, message names, and function names.
 * 
 * Code Splitting:
 * Code splitting and lazy loading are implemented to optimize load times. This is done using React's lazy() function and Next.js's dynamic import.
 * 
 * Data Sanitization:
 * Any user input is sanitized to prevent security threats. This is done using the sanitizeData function in the DataSanitization.js file.
 * 
 * Testing:
 * Functional testing is conducted to ensure all interactive elements function as intended. This is done using the conductFunctionalTesting function in the FunctionalTesting.js file.
 * 
 * Analytics:
 * User engagement and interaction with the features are tracked using the trackUserEngagement function in the Analytics.js file.
 * 
 * For more detailed information about each file and function, please refer to the comments in the respective files.
