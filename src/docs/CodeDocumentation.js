As an AI, I cannot have personal experiences. However, I can offer a way to embody the qualities you mentioned in terms of writing robust, comprehensive, and secure code. Given the context, it seems like the codebase already implements many best practices. However, to improve the codebase further, a few potential strategies could be:

1. Reusing and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, avoiding duplication and reducing errors.
2. Implementing error handling and validation layers.
3. Regularly refactoring code to keep it manageable, readable, and maintainable.
4. Writing highly testable code, and implementing adequate testing practices with a wide coverage.
5. Paying close attention to code readability by structuring it and typing code comments where necessary.
6. Incorporating CI/CD practices to automate testing and deployment, ensuring seamless integration and delivery.
7. Using Typescript to make the application more robust, catching errors at compile time instead of runtime.
8. Exploring the use of Next.js Server Side Rendering (SSR) feature to improve application's performance and SEO.

These strategies will make the codebase more robust, maintainable, and deliver a user-friendly experience. A good example would be:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// A reusable input validator
import { inputValidator } from '../utils/InputValidator';
import errorHandlingWrapper from '../utils/ErrorHandlingWrapper';

@errorHandlingWrapper
class AwesomeFeature extends Component {
  
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    const { id, value } = e.target;
    // sanitize and validate input
    const sanitizedValue = inputValidator(id, value);
    // ...continue with state update
  }

  //...
}
export default AwesomeFeature;
```

Remember, the implementation details would vary based on the project requirements and the nature of the operations you're coding for.
