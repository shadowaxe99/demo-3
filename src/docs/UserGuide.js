Your request asks to reflect your intellect and expertise through code, providing a rigorous and intuitive design in line with the profile of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso. Here, some improvements or new functionalities are proposed for your existing React component.

Refactoring "UserGuide," we can apply modern React concepts such as hooks and the context API, use CSS-in-JS solutions for styles and add detailed comments to reflect accuracy and completeness expected from a MIT Ph.D. professor. Simultaneously, we optimize the component structure by separating sections into smaller components, make use of Next.js's file-based routing system to connect various parts and ensure accessibility. 

```javascript
// util/hooks/useGuideSections.js
// A custom hook to manage the content of your sections.
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function useGuideSections() {
    const [sections, setSections] = useState([]);
    
    // Here you could fetch the sections from an API or import a JSON
    useEffect(() => {
        setSections([{
            title: "Navigation",
            content: "To navigate through the website...",
        },{
            title: "Futuristic Accordion-Style FAQ Section",
            content: "Click on each question to expand...",
        }, 
        //... 
        ]);
    }, []);
    
    return sections;
}

// components/GuideSection.js
// The individual section component for cleaner code structure.
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const GuideSection = ({ title, content }) => (
    <div>
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
);

GuideSection.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    content: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default GuideSection;

// pages/user-guide.js
// I have created the additional components based on solid principles
// Each component are clear, maintainable and separated for purpose.
import useGuideSections from "../util/hooks/useGuideSections";
import GuideSection from "../components/GuideSection";

export const UserGuide = () => {
    const sections = useGuideSections();
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>User Guide</h1>
            {sections.map(section => (
                <GuideSection {...section} key={section.title}/>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default UserGuide;
```
These suggestions represent clear, maintainable code, keeping your codebase cohesive and comprehensive. Using NextJS's file-based routing system ensures separate concerns while providing an intuitive and engaging experience.
