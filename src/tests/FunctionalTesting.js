As suggestions:

You can examine the imports in your test file. Consider utilizing container components and dividing the responsibility between smart and dumb components. Smart components can handle logic, state, and other concerns, while dumb components can only render props. 

Consider implementing lazy-loading for app performance, especially for the components that don't need to be rendered immediately. 

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const FaqSection = lazy(() => import('../components/FaqSection'));
const CarouselDisplay = lazy(() => import('../components/CarouselDisplay'));
const DoorUnveiling = lazy(() => import('../components/DoorUnveiling'));
const AiDebateSection = lazy(() => import('../components/AiDebateSection'));
const AiFortuneTeller = lazy(() => import('../components/AiFortuneTeller'));
const IsraelTributeSection = lazy(() => import('../components/IsraelTributeSection'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <FaqSection />
      <CarouselDisplay />
      ...
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```
Also, modularize your tests. Consider creating separate test files for each component instead of testing everything in a single file. It's better to have self-contained tests for each individual component. 

Remember to keep components as pure as possible. If you could make a component a pure function, go for it. Limit the number of stateful components: state management is tricky to get right and could lead to a lot of bugs if not handled properly.

Whenever possible, use Higher Order Components and Context API for passing props deep down in your component tree. Prop drilling could make your code hard to maintain.

Regularly utilise error boundary components around the different sections of your app to gracefully handle errors and improve the user experience.

Always improve the accessibility of components, like adding alt text for images, using semantic HTML, etc.

Also, don't neglect the performance. Utilize React's useMemo and useCallback hooks, so youâ€™re only computing values when something changes, and not with every render.

Stay up to date with the updates and use the latest features like React concurrent mode and others. These can drastically improve user experience.

Get used to writing tests for components as it's a crucial aspect of a stable App. Especially the implementations that include a lot of user interactions on UI.

Always look for better ways to implement a solution(handlers, context, hooks, state management libraries, etc).

Remember, there is always room for improvement!
